# Heart-Diseases
This dataset dates from 1988 and include some several databases of different country. On here I use this dataset from Kaggle website for predict the statement of heart disease using Machine Learning Algorithms.

The main object is to predict whether the given patient is having heart disease or not. So it helped for that some several variables such as, age, sex, cholesterol level, blood pressure, types of chest pains etc.

Here I used Machine Learning algorithms which are Decision Tree & Random Forest.    

I used some important libraries
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(Hmisc)
library(forcats)
library(dplyr)
library(psych)
library(C50)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
